`factorio` is a fixtures replacement tool that's been heavily influenced by
[factory boy][factory_boy]. It's intention is to hide irrelevant fields when
writing a test.

Even though it's been designed to play well with various ORMs, it tries to
avoid any interaction with a database, as the saving/retrieving an object
shouldn't be the responsibility of the factory.

Under the hood it uses [faker] to create realistic values for each field.
